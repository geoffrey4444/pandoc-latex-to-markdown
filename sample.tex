\section{Introduction}
Here is some sample introductory text. Here's a list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First item.
\item Second item.
\item Third item.
\end{enumerate}
And here's an unordered list:
\begin{itemize}
\item Some item
\item Some other item
\end{itemize}
\section{Math}
Here's a math example:
\begin{equation}
r_H = \frac{2 G M}{c^2},
\end{equation} where $r_H$ is the horizion radius 
of a nonspinning black hole, $M$ is the horizon mass, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c$ is the speed of light. Here's 
a more complicated equation:
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b x^2 dx = \frac{b^3}{3} - \frac{a^3}{3}.
\end{equation}
